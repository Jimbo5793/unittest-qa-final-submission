[Feature Name] Coin Change Algorithm

Title:
Missing Constraint Checks and Incorrect Initialization in the Original Coin Change Algorithm

Environment:
Python 3.12.2

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the original coin_change method with an inappropriate input for coins and amount.
2. Observe the output and behavior.

Expected Result:
The original coin_change method should handle the input gracefully and provide correct results according to the problem constraints.

Actual Result:
The original coin_change method does not have proper constraint checks and initialization. This leads to errors and incorrect results when the input does not meet the problem constraints.

Visual Proof:
N/A

Severity/Priority:
High
(because this would break constraints and perform inaccurately)

Details:

1. Title: Missing Constraint Checks
   - Description: The original code lacks any checks for the constraints on coins and amount.
   - Impact: This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the input values do not meet the problem constraints.

2. Title: Incorrect Handling of Large Amounts
   - Description: The original code may not handle large amounts (greater than 10,000) correctly.
   - Impact: Results may be inaccurate or the code could run into performance issues due to excessive computation.

3. Title: Potential Index Out of Range Error
   - Description: The dp array is initialized with dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1), which can cause an index out of range error when amount is 0.
   - Impact: The code may raise an IndexError or produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Solution in the Improved Code

1. Added Constraint Checks
   - Description: Introduced checks to ensure coins array has between 1 and 12 elements, each coin value is between 1 and 2^31 - 1, and amount is between 0 and 10,000.

2. Proper Initialization of dp Array
   - Description: Adjusted the initialization of the dp array to correctly handle the base case where amount is 0.

3. Added Clear Error Messages
   - Description: Provided clear error messages when constraints are violated to help with debugging and troubleshooting.


TL:DR
In summary, the original code lacked proper constraint checks and initialization, which could lead to errors and incorrect results. 
The improved code addressed these issues by adding constraint checks, ensuring correct initialization of the dp array, and providing clear error messages. 
This improves reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the code.
