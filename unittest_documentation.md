Test Name: TestCoinChange

Environment:
Python 3.12.2

unittest module

Tests:

1. test_basic_functionality
   - Purpose: Verify basic functionality of the coin_change method with typical inputs.
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Coins: [2], Amount: 3 → Expected: -1
     - Coins: [1], Amount: 0 → Expected: 0

2. test_edge_cases
   - Purpose: Test edge cases such as maximum constraints and very small amounts.
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [1], Amount: 10000 → Expected: 10000
     - Coins: [1], Amount: 10001 → Expected: Raises ValueError (amount too large)
     - Coins: [100], Amount: 400 → Expected: 4
     - Coins: [100], Amount: 401 → Expected: -1

3. test_special_cases
   - Purpose: Test special cases including an empty coins array and arrays with duplicate values.
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [], Amount: 10 → Expected: Raises ValueError (empty coins array)
     - Coins: [1000, 2000, 5000], Amount: 7000 → Expected: 2
     - Coins: [1, 1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3

4. test_error_handling
   - Purpose: Test error handling with invalid inputs.
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [], Amount: 100000 → Expected: Raises ValueError (amount too large)
     - Coins: [1, 2, 3, ..., 13], Amount: 10 → Expected: Raises ValueError (coins array too large)
     - Coins: [1, 2147483648], Amount: 10 → Expected: Raises ValueError (coin value too high)
     - Coins: [1, 2, 3], Amount: -1 → Expected: Raises ValueError (negative amount)

5. test_performance
   - Purpose: Test the performance of the coin_change method with a large amount and reasonable size coins array.
   - Test Case:
     - Coins: [1, 2, 3, ..., 12], Amount: 10000 → Expected: 834

6. test_using_stubs
   - Purpose: Test the coin_change method using a stub to ensure correct behavior.
   - Test Case:
     - Stub always returns 3 for any input.
     - Coins: [1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3

7. test_with_setup_teardown 
   - Purpose: Test the coin_change method using separate instances of the Solution class.
   - Test Cases:
     - Instance 1: Coins: [1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Instance 2: Coins: [2], Amount: 3 → Expected: -1
     - Instance 3: Coins: [1], Amount: 0 → Expected: 0

8. test_parametrization
   - Purpose: Test the coin_change method using parameterized inputs. (proof of concept, not necessary)
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Coins: [2], Amount: 3 → Expected: -1
     - Coins: [1], Amount: 0 → Expected: 0
     - Coins: [1, 1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Coins: [1000, 2000, 5000], Amount: 7000 → Expected: 2
     - Coins: [], Amount: 10 → Expected: -1

9. test_parametrization_with_stubs
   - Purpose: Test the coin_change method using parameterized inputs with a stub. (proof of concept, not necessary)
   - Test Cases:
     - Coins: [1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Coins: [2], Amount: 3 → Expected: -1
     - Coins: [1], Amount: 0 → Expected: 0
     - Coins: [1, 1, 2, 5], Amount: 11 → Expected: 3
     - Coins: [1000, 2000, 5000], Amount: 7000 → Expected: 2
     - Coins: [], Amount: 10 → Expected: -1

Expected Failures:
- test_parametrization: This test is expected to fail because the original implementation does not handle an empty coins array correctly.

Test Case Summary:
- Total Tests: 9
- Passed: 8
- Expected Failures: 1
